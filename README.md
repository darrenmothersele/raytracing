# Ray Tracing

My test ray tracing.

Working through Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](http://in1weekend.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/ray-tracing-rest-of-your-life.html)
tutorial. But with some changes I've made along way:

 - Chapter 1: I've used [FreeImage](http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/) to output a PNG file, rather than writing out RGB data as PPM file.
 - Chapter 2: I'm using [OpenGL Math library](http://glm.g-truc.net/), rather than implementing my own Vector class.
 - Chapter 3: Simple ray and background gradient
 - Chapter 4: Added single red sphere
 - Chapter 5: Surface normals and multiple objects
